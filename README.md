# OrangeHRM-Automation-Testing-Ongoing-

The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive testing of the Myinfo module and login functionality on the OrangeHRM Demo platform. The project will utilize data-driven testing techniques to ensure thorough coverage and efficient test execution. The project will make use of various tools and libraries such as WebDriverManager, Selenium framework, Pytest framework, Pytest-xdist plugin, Pytest-html plugin, and Openpyxl library.

# Project Features

Myinfo Module Testing: The Myinfo module of OrangeHRM Demo will be tested extensively to ensure its functionality, accuracy, and data integrity. This includes validating user information, updating personal details, managing documents, and any other relevant features.

Login Functionality Testing: The login functionality of OrangeHRM Demo will be thoroughly tested to ensure secure and seamless access for users. Different scenarios, such as valid and invalid credentials, password resets, and session management, will be covered.

Data-Driven Testing: The project will leverage data-driven testing techniques to enhance test coverage and efficiency. Test data will be sourced from external files, such as Excel spreadsheets, using the Openpyxl library. This approach allows for easy test data management and scalability.

Browser Compatibility: The project will use WebDriverManager to handle various browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. This ensures cross-browser compatibility, allowing the tests to be executed on different browsers without modifying the test scripts.

Test Automation: The Selenium framework will be utilized for automating web browsers and interacting with the OrangeHRM Demo platform. It provides a powerful set of tools for simulating user actions, validating web elements, and performing assertions.

Test Execution and Reporting: The Pytest framework will be employed for organizing, executing, and managing the tests. The Pytest-xdist plugin will enable parallel test execution, significantly reducing the overall test execution time. Additionally, the Pytest-html plugin will generate an HTML report summarizing the test results, making it easy to analyze and share the test outcomes.

(Project is ongoing, with additional test cases and CI/CD pipeline integration planned.)
